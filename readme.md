# Nimble instances dashboard

An xlsx file to monitor your instances and NIM balance daily, and helping you to track your cost.

## How does it work ?

The file is organized in two tabs.

The first one, **"Instances dashboard"** to provide your instances data.
From this, it will give you an overview of your current cost, and the total cost of each instance.

The second one, **"Balance & Cost"**, allow you to report your balance and it will calculate automatically your daily reward and the cost per token, based on your instance cost.

*NB: The "now" date for the calculs should be updated every hours. If not, you can update the parameter in the file's settings. It will also refresh after a change is made to the file.*


This file suits well for me with my instance running on Vast, but it's still experimental and probably need to be adapted to your own needs.


**/!\ This file has been fed with fake data, for example, do not compare your result with.**


The file is an xlsx file, that you can download from this repository ([Nimble community dashboard.xlsx](https://github.com/Cl0dev/nimble-instances-dashboard/blob/main/Nimble%20community%20dashboard.xlsx))
